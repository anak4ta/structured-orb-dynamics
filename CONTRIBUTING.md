# Contributing

This project is mainly a record of the work used in the PR018 study.  
Changes are generally small and focused on keeping the code and the manuscript aligned.

If you notice an issue in the scripts or the documentation:

– open an issue with a short note about what you found  
– include the file name and the line number if possible  
– if you have a fix, you can attach it or send a pull request

Please keep changes simple.  
The code here is meant to show the steps used in the analysis, not to build a larger software package.

Pull requests should only touch one thing at a time (tracking, feature extraction, or small documentation edits).  
Large refactors are not needed.

Thanks for helping keep the work clear and reproducible.
