# Code of Conduct

This project is a research archive.  
Discussions, issues, and pull requests should stay focused on the code, the manuscript, or the data included here.

Please keep interactions respectful and clear.  
If something is unclear or incorrect, describe the problem directly and suggest a simple fix if you have one.

Harassment or personal comments are not acceptable.  
If a problem comes up, open an issue and it will be handled quietly.

The goal is to keep the work usable and easy to understand for anyone reading it.
