# Geometry-First Motion Analysis (Methodology)

This directory contains a methodological companion document describing a
geometry-first, descriptive approach to motion analysis under data constraints.

The manuscript focuses on:
- observable geometric structure
- explicit assumptions and scope
- reproducible, falsifiable analytical procedures

It is intended to **sit alongside** application-specific analyses (including
Structured Orb Dynamics), not to replace or compete with them.
