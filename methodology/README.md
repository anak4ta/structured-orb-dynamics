# Geometry-First Motion Analysis (Methodology)

This directory contains methodological companion documents describing a
geometry-first, descriptive approach to motion analysis under data constraints.

The work here is concerned with **how motion is approached**, not with
explaining, predicting, or inferring causes beyond what the data can support.

The focus is on:
- observable geometric structure
- explicit assumptions and scope
- reproducible, falsifiable analytical procedures

These documents are intended to **sit alongside** application-specific analyses
(including *Structured Orb Dynamics*), not to replace or compete with them.

## Start Here — Reader Standard (Compass)

**Geometry-First Motion Analysis: A Descriptive Standard**

A short, reader-facing document defining the analytical posture used when
motion can be observed but certainty is unavailable.

This document serves as a **methodological compass** — a guide for how
analysis is conducted under constraint.

📄 **[Download the Reader Standard (PDF)](geometry-first-descriptive-standard.pdf)**


## Full Methodology — Technical Manuscript (Map)

**A Geometry-First Approach to Motion Analysis Under Data Constraints**

A longer technical manuscript detailing assumptions, scope, limitations,
and the structure of geometry-first motion analysis.

This document functions as a **methodological map**, supporting careful,
reproducible analysis once orientation is established.
